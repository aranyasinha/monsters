Basic Framework for a Turn-based combat game.

## Origin
It is based on the First generation of Pokemon games (Red & Blue/Green).
Many of the initial work has been adapted directly from their in-game mechanics as it is.
**Caution:** *It is based on my Highschool project which was originally written in C89. Some parts are still in need of being updated for C++11/C++14.*

## Reference for the mechanics
https://serebii.net/games/mechanics.shtml

## Current Status
The program is in **Alpha stage**, *ie; It doesn't function yet.*

## Prerequites
### 1. - Downloading the source
Latest source file is available at:
For the whole git:
https://github.com/Danpar97/monsters.git
For the source file only:
https://github.com/Danpar97/monsters/blob/master/source/monsters.cpp

### 2. -  Compiling
Any IDE using GNU C/C++ Compiler
**Note:** *Have to test compatibility with Visual C++.*

## Roadmap
The project is meant to be a basic framework for any game with similar mechanics and thus needs to be able to allow a more general approach than the current Pokemon based.
The Pokemon specific codes should continue to exist and evolve for referencing use cases for each and every function. 
If functions &/or mechanics can't be merged with the original one a new branch will be created to accomodate the new ones with adjusted base classes and functions
Please make a fork if you wish to adapt the framework for a game by combining it with some external (non-standard C/C++) library.

## Disclaimer
Although I have mentioned adapting mechanics "as is" they are not representative of actual mechancs but rather supposition of observed behaviour in game.
This Project is in no way meant to be a game itself and thus use of any copyrighted material is strictly forbidden on public medium.
