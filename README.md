Basic Framework for a Turn-based combat game.

# Origin
It is based on the First generation of Pokemon games (Red & Blue/Green), 
with 16 types (that includes types upto 5th Gen, ie; Black/White 2).
Many of the initial work has been adapted directly from their in-game mechanics as it is.

# Roadmap
The project is meant to be a basic framework for any game with similar mechanics and thus needs to be able to allow a more general approach than the current Pokemon based.
The Pokemon specific codes should continue to exist and evolve for referencing use cases for each and every function. 
If functions &/or mechanics can't be merged with the original one a new branch will be created to accomodate the new ones with adjusted base classes and functions
Please make a fork if you wish to adapt the framework for a game by combining it with some external (non-standard C/C++) library.

# Disclaimer
Although I have mentioned adapting mechanics "as is" they are not representative of actual mechancs but rather supposition of observed behaviour in game.
This Project is in no way meant to be a game itself and thus use of any copyrighted material is strictly forbidden on public medium.
